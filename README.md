# NOTES-APP (Catatanku)

This App is a submission project from "Membangun Aplikasi Catatan Menggunakan React" on Dicoding .  

What I have learned in developing this application include:
- Get acquainted with React.js and its development ecosystem.
- Basic concepts such as composition, declarative code, unidirectional data flow, and realizing that react is just javascript.
- Learn about building UI in React such as recognizing elements and components. Also, learn the concept of component properties that make UI applications reusable.
- Learn about component classes, using state in components, changing state values based on event handling, and understanding and practicing controlled components.
